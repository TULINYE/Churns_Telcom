### OVERVIEW 
In this study, I analyzed the 'SyriaTel Customer Churn' data. The SyriaTel is a telecommunication company. The purpose of the study is to predict whether a customer will ("soon") stop doing business with SyriaTel.
### BUSINESS PROBLEM
A telecommunications company based in the United States is seeking to reduce its customer attrition rate, which currently stands at 15%. This high churn rate is driving up marketing expenses as the company must continually acquire new customers. Presently, the company employs a random approach to offer discounts or incentives to certain customers without prior knowledge of their intent to leave or stay. Their objective is to proactively detect customers likely to churn and employ strategies to retain them, while avoiding unnecessary spending on customers who have no intention of leaving. Key questions that we aim to address include:

What are the primary customer characteristics that can effectively predict customer churn?
Can we accurately identify customers who are on the verge of leaving?
Is it possible to minimize the allocation of discounts or incentives to customers who have no intention of churning?
